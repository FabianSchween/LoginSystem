# LoginSystem
Simple login card with backend functionality using Angular, Node.js, and MySQL.

This project was created as a learning exercise to practice full-stack development and data exchange between frontend and backend systems. The main focus was on:

Sending and receiving user data between frontend and backend

Storing data in a MySQL database

Setting up basic HTTP POST routes in Node.js

Note:
There is no username uniqueness check implemented, so multiple accounts with the same username can be created. Passwords are stored in plain text for demonstration purposes only and are not secured using hashing or encryption.
